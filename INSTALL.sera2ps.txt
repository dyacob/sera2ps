BEFORE STARTING

First, check if you have the GNU C compiler on your system.  You
may do this by typing "gcc" at your command line.  If you get any
message other than "gcc: Command not found.", then most likely
you do have it.  If not, you will be able to compile most of the 
files with regular "cc" but the "coco" executable.  You may then
wish build everything else and obtain a copy of "coco" from a friend
who compiled on a machine just like yours.  Sorry about this, it
should not be a limitation in the future. 

To unpack  :

  tar -zxvf sera2ps-2.3.8.tar.gz

( or in two steps :
  gunzip sera2ps-2.3.8.tar.gz 
  tar -xvf sera2ps-2.3.8.tar
)

TO COMPILE:  

        % make       - makes everything.
        % make clean - removes unnecessary files.

You should now be ready to laser print the sample files in
the "docs" directory.  Read the "README" file for usage
instructions.


IF YOU DO NOT HAVE gcc AND flex

You should then have ``cc'' and ``lex''.  You may edit the sera2/Makefile 
in lines 2 and 5 for gcc and flex.


DEFAULT LANGUAGE

You may change the default language rules by editing commenting out and
uncommenting the choices on lines 29-31 of the sera2/sera2.c file.  
Tigrigna rules are the default if no change is made.


Installing Man Pages
---------------------

The files docs/pssera.1, docs/sera.1, docs/sera2any.1 are provided man
page instructions for Unix systems.  If you can not install the
man pages into a system man directory.  You may create your own
man directory by:

   % cd sera2ps-2.3.8
   % mkdir man
   % mkdir man/man1
   % cp docs/*.1 man/man1
   % setenv MANPATH $MANPATH":"$PWD/man
   % man pssera
   % man sera
   % man sera2any

It is more practical to set your new MANPATH in your .cshrc file
where the $PWD/man directory in the above is replaced the complete
path name for your man directory.


Libeth And DOS I/O
------------------

If you expect to go between DOS and Unix regularly you may wish to
compile libeth to perform DOS text conversions.  DOS I/O is NOT the
default compilation for libeth as it slows down the transliteration
performance for large files.  Follow the directions in 
sera2/README.dosio to install for DOS support.
